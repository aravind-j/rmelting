The parameters were tested by predicting the secondary structures of sequences with known secondary structure that are from organisms with known optimal growth temperatures. Compared with the previous set of enthalpy nearest neighbor parameters, the sensitivity of base pair prediction improved from 65.2 to 68.9\% at optimal growth temperatures ranging from 10 to 60°C. Base pair probabilities were predicted with a partition function and the positive predictive value of structure prediction is 90.4\% when considering the base pairs in the lowest free energy structure with pairing probability of 0.99 or above. Moreover, a strong correlation is found between the predicted melting temperatures of RNA sequences and the optimal growth temperatures of the host organism. This indicates that organisms that live at higher temperatures have evolved RNA sequences with higher melting temperatures.},

When an A*-N pair (N, any nucleotide base) was

of the duplexes were similar for all the natural bases except A
(N = T, C and G). On the other hand, for the duplexes with

on their sequence. The order of stability is T {\textgreater} G {\textgreater} C {\textgreater}{\textgreater} A

Increasing formamide concentration decreases the renaturation rate linearly by 1.1\% per percent formamide such that the optimal rate in 50\% formamide is 0.45 the optimal rate in an identical solution with no formamide.

Abstract?DNA secondary structure plays an important role in biology, genotyping diagnostics, a variety of molecular biology techniques, in vitro?selected DNA catalysts, nanotechnology, and DNA-based computing. Accurate prediction of DNA secondary structure and hybridization using dynamic programming algorithms requires a database of thermodynamic parameters for several motifs including Watson-Crick base pairs, internal mismatches, terminal mismatches, terminal dangling ends, hairpins, bulges, internal loops, and multibranched loops. To make the database useful for predictions under a variety of salt conditions, empirical equations for monovalent and magnesium dependence of thermodynamics have been developed. Bimolecular hybridization is often inhibited by competing unimolecular folding of a target or probe DNA. Powerful numerical methods have been developed to solve multistate-coupled equilibria in bimolecular and higher-order complexes. This review presents the current parameter set available for making accurate DNA structure predictions and also points to future directions for improvement.},

Extensive experimental data demonstrate that the TBI theory gives improved predictions for multivalent ions (e.g., Mg(2+)) than the Poisson-Boltzmann theory. In this study, we use the TBI theory to investigate how the metal ions affect the folding stability of B-DNA helices. We quantitatively evaluate the effects of ion concentration, ion size and valence, and helix length on the helix stability. Moreover, we derive practically useful analytical formulas for the thermodynamic parameters as functions of finite helix length, ion type, and ion concentration. We find that the helix stability is additive for high ion concentration and long helix and nonadditive for low ion concentration and short helix.

In the present study, we investigate the effects of ion correlation and fluctuation on the thermodynamic stability of finite length RNA helices immersed in a mixed solution of monovalent and divalent ions. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that the model gives improved predictions over the Poisson-Boltzmann theory, which has been found to underestimate the roles of multivalent ions such as Mg(2+) in stabilizing DNA and RNA helices. The tightly bound ion model makes quantitative predictions on how the Na(+)-Mg(2+) competition determines helix stability and its helix length-dependence.

	abstract = {Background: Many techniques in molecular biology depend on the oligonucleotide melting temperature (Tm), and several formulas have been developed to estimate Tm. Nearest-neighbor (N-N) models provide the highest accuracy for Tm prediction, but it is not clear how to adjust these models for the effects of reagents commonly used in PCR, such as Mg2+, deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
Methods: The experimental Tms of 475 matched or mismatched target/probe duplexes were obtained in our laboratories or were compiled from the literature based on studies using the same real-time PCR platform. This data set was used to evaluate the contributions of [Mg2+], [dNTPs], and [DMSO] in N-N calculations. In addition, best-fit coefficients for common empirical formulas based on GC content, length, and the equivalent sodium ion concentration of cations [Na+eq] were obtained by multiple regression.
Results: When we used [Na+eq] = [Monovalent cations] + 120({\textless}img class="highwire-embed tex" alt="Math" src="https://d9aqs07uebq07.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/highwire/clinchem/47/11/1956/embed/tex-math-1.gif"/{\textgreater}) (the concentrations in this formula are mmol/L) to correct <U+0394>S0 and a DMSO term of 0.75 °C (\%DMSO), the SE of the N-N Tm estimate was 1.76 °C for perfectly matched duplexes (n = 217). Alternatively, the empirical formula Tm (°C) = 77.1 °C + 11.7 * log[Na+eq] + 0.41(\%GC) - 528/bp - 0.75 °C(\%DMSO) gave a slightly higher SE of 1.87 °C. When all duplexes (matched and mismatched; n = 475) were included in N-N calculations, the SE was 2.06 °C.
Conclusions: This robust model, accounting for the effects of Mg2+, DMSO, and dNTPs on oligonucleotide Tm in PCR, gives reliable Tm predictions using thermodynamic N-N calculations or empirical formulas.},

We obtained the relevant thermodynamic data from calorimetric studies on 19 DNA oligomers and 9 DNA polymers. We show how these thermodynamic data can be used to calculate the stability and predict the temperature-dependent behavior of any DNA duplex structure from knowledge of its base sequence. We illustrate our method of calculation by using the nearest-neighbor data to predict transition enthalpies and free energies for a series of DNA oligomers. These predicted values are in excellent agreement with the corresponding values determined experimentally. This agreement demonstrates that a DNA duplex structure thermodynamically can be considered to be the sum of its nearest-neighbor interactions. Armed with this knowledge and the nearest-neighbor thermodynamic data reported here, scientists now will be able to predict the stability (delta G degree) and the melting behavior (delta H degree) of any DNA duplex structure from inspection of its primary sequence. This capability should prove valuable in numerous applications, such as predicting the stability of a probe-gene complex; selecting optimal conditions for a hybridization experiment; deciding on the minimum length of a probe; predicting the influence of a specific transversion or transition on the stability of an affected DNA region; and predicting the relative stabilities of local domains within a DNA duplex.},

	abstract = {The thermodynamic contributions to duplex formation of all 32 possible single-nucleotide dangling ends on a Watson-Crick pair are reported. In most instances, dangling ends are stabilizing with free energy contributions ranging from +0.48 ( ) to -0.96 kcal/mol ( ). In comparison, Watson-Crick nearest-neighbor increments range from -0.58 (TA/AT) to -2.24 (GC/CG) kcal/mol. Hence, in some cases, a dangling end contributes as much to duplex stability as a Watson-Crick A-T base pair. The implications of these results for DNA probe design are discussed. Analysis of the sequence dependence of dangling-end stabilities show that the nature of the closing base pair largely determines the stabilization. For a given closing base pair, however, adenine dangling ends are always more or equally as stable as the other dangling nucleotides. Moreover, 5' dangling ends are more or equally as stabilizing as their 3' counterparts. Comparison of DNA with RNA dangling-end motifs shows that DNA motifs with 5' dangling ends contribute to stability equally or more than their RNA counterparts. Conversely, RNA 3' dangling ends contribute to stability equally or more than their DNA counterparts. This data set has been incorporated into a DNA secondary structure prediction algorithm (DNA MFOLD) (http://mfold2.wustl.edu/{\textasciitilde}mfold/dna/form1.cgi ) as well as a DNA hybridization prediction algorithm (HyTher™) (http://jsl1.chem.wayne.edu/Hyther/hythermenu.html ).},

Results are consistent with neighbor-pair thermodynamic additivity, where the stability constant, sij , for different domains of length N depend quantitatively on the product of stability constants for each individual pair in domains, sijN . Unit transition enthalpies with average errors less than +/-5\%, were determined by analysis of two-state equilibria associated with the melting of internal domains and verified from variations of Tij with [Na+]. Enthalpies increase with Tij , in close agreement with the empirical function: Delta Hij = 52.78@ Tij - 9489, and in parallel with a smaller increase in Delta Sij . Delta Hij and Delta Sij are in good agreement with the results of an extensive compilation of published Delta Hcal and Delta Scal for synthetic and natural DNAs. Neighbor-pair additivity was also observed for (dA@dT)-tracts at melting temperatures; no evidence could be detected of the familiar and unusual structural features that characterize tracts at lower temperatures. The energetic effects of loops were determined from the melting behavior of repeating inserts installed between (G+C)-rich barrier domains in the pN/MCS plasmids. A unique set of values for the cooperativity, loop exponent and stiffness parameters were found applicable to internal domains of all sizes and sequences. Statistical mechanical curves calculated with values of Tij([Na+]) , Delta Hij and these loop parameters are in good agreement with observation.},

The inherent cooperativity of melting is unaffected by the denaturant. dTm / dCF for 11 plasmid domains of 0.23 \&lt; (G+C) \&lt; 0.71 generally fit to a linear dependence on (G+C)-content, which, however, is consistent with a (G+C)-independent alteration in the apparent equilibrium constant for thermally induced helix<U+2194>coil transitions. Results indicate that formamide has a destabilizing effect on the helical state, and that sequence-dependent variations in hydration patterns are primarily responsible for small variations in sensitivity to the denaturant. The average unit transition enthalpy  exhibits a biphasic dependence on formamide concentration. The initial drop of -0.8 kcal/mol bp at low formamide concentrations is attributable to a  for exchange of solvent in the vicinity of the helix: displacement by formamide of weakly bound hydrate or counterion. The phenomenological effects are equivalent to lowering the bulk counterion concentration. Poly(dA-dT) exhibits a much lower sensitivity to formamide, due to the specific pattern of tightly bound, immobilized water bridges that buttress the helix from within the narrow minor groove. Tracts of three (A-T)-pairs behave normally, but tracts of six exhibit the same level of reduced sensitivity as the polymer, suggesting a conformational shift as tracts are elongated beyond some critical length [  McCarthy,J.G. and Rich,A.

In order to identify the most frequently occurring 1 * 2 nucleotide internal loops, a database of 955 RNA secondary structures was compiled and searched. Twenty-four RNA duplexes containing the most common 1 * 2 nucleotide loops were optically melted, and the thermodynamic parameters <U+0394>H°, <U+0394>S°, <U+0394>G°37, and TM for each duplex were determined. This data set more than doubles the number of 1 * 2 nucleotide loops previously studied. A table of experimental free energy contributions for frequently occurring 1 * 2 nucleotide loops (as opposed to a predictive model) is likely to result in better prediction of RNA secondary structure from sequence. In order to improve free energy calculations for duplexes containing 1 * 2 nucleotide loops that do not have experimental free energy contributions, the data collected here were combined with data from 21 previously studied 1 * 2 loops. Using linear regression, the entire dataset was used to derive nearest neighbor parameters that can be used to predict the thermodynamics of previously unmeasured 1 * 2 nucleotide loops. The <U+0394>G°37,loop and <U+0394>H°loop nearest neighbor parameters derived here were compared to values that were published previously for 1 * 2 nucleotide loops but were derived from either a significantly smaller dataset of 1 * 2 nucleotide loops or from internal loops of various sizes [Lu, Z. J., Turner, D. H., and Mathews, D. H. (2006) Nucleic Acids Res. 34, 4912-4924]. Most of these values were found to be within experimental error, suggesting that previous approximations and assumptions associated with the derivation of those nearest neighbor parameters were valid. <U+0394>S°loop nearest neighbor parameters are also reported for 1 * 2 nucleotide loops. Both the experimental thermodynamics and the nearest neighbor parameters reported here can be used to improve secondary structure prediction from sequence.},

	volume = {11},
	doi = {10.1261/rna.7254905},
	abstract = {Thermodynamic parameters are reported for duplex formation in 1 M NaCl for 16 RNA sequences, each containing a core tetramer duplex, GGCC, and a 3' overhang consisting of two bases. The results indicate additional double-helical stability is conferred by the double 3' terminal overhang relative to the single 3' terminal overhang. A nearest-neighbor analysis of the data indicates that the free energy contribution at 37°C of the second base in the double 3' terminal overhang varies from 0 to 0.7 kcal/mol. The second base in the 3' double overhang can contribute nearly the same stability to a duplex as a base pair or a 3' dangling overhang. Stability contribution of a dangling base, two nucleotides removed from the 3' end of a duplex, is dependent upon both the identity of the base as well as that of the dangling base that it neighbors. A second dangling base only increases the stability of the duplex when it is neighboring a 3' purine dangling nucleotide. Furthermore, a second dangling pyrimidine provides a greater contribution to duplex stability than a purine. A nearest-neighbor model was developed to predict the influence of 3' double overhang on the stability of duplex formation. The model improves the prediction of free energy and melting temperature when tested against six sequences with different core duplexes.},

	title = {Comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of 3' double-nucleotide overhangs neighboring {Watson}-{Crick} terminal base pairs},
	volume = {34},
	doi = {10.1093/nar/gkl428},
	abstract = {Thermodynamic parameters are reported for duplex formation of 48 self-complementary RNA duplexes containing Watson-Crick terminal base pairs (GC, AU and UA) with all 16 possible 3' double-nucleotide overhangs; mimicking the structures of short interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNAs (miRNA). Based on nearest-neighbor analysis, the addition of a second dangling nucleotide to a single 3' dangling nucleotide increases stability of duplex formation up to 0.8 kcal/mol in a sequence dependent manner. Results from this study in conjunction with data from a previous study [A. S. O'Toole, S. Miller and M. J. Serra (2005) RNA, 11, 512.] allows for the development of a refined nearest-neighbor model to predict the influence of 3' double-nucleotide overhangs on the stability of duplex formation. The model improves the prediction of free energy and melting temperature when tested against five oligomers with various core duplex sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of naturally occurring miRNAs was performed to support our results. Selection of the effector miR strand of the mature miRNA duplex appears to be dependent upon the identity of the 3' double-nucleotide overhang. Thermodynamic parameters for 3' single terminal overhangs adjacent to a UA pair are also presented.},
